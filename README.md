# Project Overlord: A Strategic Command-and-Control Simulation

**"We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender."** - Winston Churchill

## Overview

Project Overlord is a high‑fidelity simulation of Allied command‑and‑control operations during the Second World War. It is designed to train strategists, test tactical doctrines, and provide a sandbox for exploring the monumental decisions that shaped the course of history.

## Mission

To deliver a robust, historically‑accurate platform that allows commanders to:

- Plan and execute large‑scale amphibious assaults.
- Manage complex logistics chains across hostile waters.
- Coordinate multi‑national forces under a unified command.
- Simulate the fog of war and the friction of communication.

## Principles

1. **Clarity of Purpose** – Every line of code must serve a strategic goal.
2. **Resilience Under Fire** – The system must remain operational even when components fail.
3. **Historical Fidelity** – Where possible, the simulation shall reflect the actual constraints and capabilities of the period.
4. **Inspiring Leadership** – The project shall be a beacon of excellence, rallying its contributors to achieve what once seemed impossible.
